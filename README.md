# Alex Zhu, Lukas Li - Race Against Time

## Version 0.1.0

This version has four seperate sections, all invidually functional. The [Main.java](./Main.java) is runnable, showing the general structure of the game, but with only the [title](./TitleScreen.java) and [main menu](./MainMenu.java) screens. Both are not completely finished, only with the general structure down to show structure. On the Main Menu, since no other screens are fully completed yet, the button for level 1 will bring you to the Title Page.

In the folder [Level1](./Level1/), the [Level1.java](./Level1/Level1.java) is runnable, to show how the Level 1 game would look like, ultilizing the [TextBox](./Level1/TextBox.java) class.

In the folder [Level2](./Level2/), the [Level2Driver.java](./Level2/Level2Driver.java) is also runnable to show the drag and drop components used in the second level.

In the folder [Level3](./Level3/), the [Level3.java](./Level3/Level3.java) is also runnable, to show a basic framework of the Level 3 game, ultilizing the [Item](./Level3/Item.java) class.
