Alex Zhu, Lukas Li - Race Against Time


## Version 0.1.0


This version has four seperate sections, all invidually functional. The Main.java is runnable, showing the general structure of the game, but with only the title and main menu screens. Both are not completely finished, only with the general structure down to show structure. On the Main Menu, since no other screens are fully completed yet, the button for level 1 will bring you to the Title Page.
In the folder Level1, the Level1.java is runnable, to show how the Level 1 game would look like, ultilizing the TextBox class.
In the folder Level2, the Level2Driver.java is also runnable to show the drag and drop components used in the second level.
In the folder Level3, the Level3.java is also runnable, to show a basic framework of the Level 3 game, ultilizing the Item class.


## Version 0.2.0


This version has five folders, each independant of each other.
The Helper contains two helper classes, TextBox and DragAndDrop classs, each used in other classes as components.
The Level1 folder contains the files for Level 1, where the Level1.java is runnable.
In the Level2 folder, there is a Level 2 Driver, which is runnable to show the framework of the game implemented in the Level2 class. This uses the Drag and Drop class in the Helper folder. The Level 2 Rule page is unfinished, but has the general framework of the screen.
The Level3 folder has not changed from version 0.1.0
All files that were previously in the current directory has all been moved to the Main folder, and no files have been changed since 0.1.0.


## Version 1.0.0
